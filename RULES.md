# Data Engineering Discord Community Guidelines

This Discord is a place for data engineers and those interested in data
engineering to learn, talk shop, ask questions, get career and interviewing
advice and level up in our craft. Everyone is welcome regardless of experience
level! Come say hi!

## The Rules

We want to create a positive and fun experience for all participants
regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, religion or
anything else. As such, we don't tolerate harrassment of participants in any
form, and implement a number of other rules designed to keep discussion healthy
and relaxed.

While this isn't by any means an exhaustive list of what constitutes
harrassment, this includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
  mental and physical disabilities, physical appearance, race
  or religion
* Gratuitous and/or off-topic sexual images/behavior (please don't link us porn)
* Threats of violence
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking
* Using logs for harrassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwanted sexual attention
* DMing people in the community after they have requested that you stop
* Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their
  consent
* Publication of DMs and chat logs
 
Beyond that, the list of additional rules and guidelines is pretty short:

* No spam. This includes promoting other Discord channels, etc., without permission
* Try to not DM people without asking first - many people are fine with it but some people don't like being messaged privately
* You may put any relevant job postings in the `#job-board` channel
* You may link to informational blog posts or talks you've put together in the `#resources` channel if they're on-topic
* You may post projects you've worked on in any channel as long as they're on-topic - or in `#off-topic`, as long as it's not disruptive

The moderators reserve the right to exclude people from this Discord based
on past behavior either inside or outside of the Data Engineering Discord.

The moderators also reserve the right to change these rules at any time. These rules
will be posted in a timely fashion.

# Consequences

People asked to stop any of these behaviors must comply immediately. While the
moderators are generally kind and understanding and will most likely give you
multiple warnings, they may mute or ban you at their discretion with or without
a warning.

Remember: [If [we] notice you repeatedly nudging the table, you won't get to play anymore.](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/260927/is-questioning-a-warning-on-meta-a-bannable-offense/260928#260928)

## Reporting

If you are being harrassed by a user of the Data Engineering Discord, notice that someone
*else* is being harrassed, see one of the other rules is being blatantly
broken, or have *any other concerns whatsoever*, DM one of your moderators:

* `Josh H <@jfhbrook>`

Share with this moderator your troubles. Logs help. We have lives
outside the context of moderation; however, we will try to be prompt. We will
take your complaint seriously, and work with you to decide on a correct course
of action.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims.
We however reserve the right to call out people with a history of complaints.
