# Data Engineering Discord

## The Rules

See `RULES.md`.

## Setup

This project includes both an `environment.yml` for Conda based workflows and a
`requirements.txt` file for virtualenv/pip based workflows. Conda delegates to
the requirements file. Otherwise, this project's setup is unopinionated with
respect to how Python is installed and managed.

## Tools

In an activated environment, run the `de` command. It should be somewhat
self-documenting.
